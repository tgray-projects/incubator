# incubator
Quick duck incubator code.

Built using a styrofoam cooler, two 3V fans, a [Power Switch Tail II](http://www.powerswitchtail.com/), 
an Arduino Uno, a thermal probe, and a 40W desk lamp.  Humidity is maintained via a wet sponge under the
lamp and frequent misting with water.  Eggs are rotated manually twice per day.
